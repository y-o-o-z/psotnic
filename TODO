0.1
---
- fix segfault when opping bots after they observed lots of mode changes (?)
 
0.2
---
- remove --with-ssl, there's an autocheck already
- remove .chaddr
- remove make debug
  - add ./configure --(with-)debug
- new botnetmodel - main/slave/leaf is awful
  - trees like that should be possible:
     A
     |-B
       |-C
         |-D
