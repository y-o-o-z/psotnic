gay-psotnic changes:

features
--------
- multiple listenports
  - can be for "all", "users" or "bots"
  - example conf entries:
     listen 127.0.0.1 9000 all
     listen ::1 9001 all
     listen ssl:0.0.0.0 9003 users
     listen 0.0.0.0 9004 bots
- allow bots to link over ipv6
  - hint: use .+addr <bot> <ipv6>
- improved partyline:
  - partyline must be joined by irc client, e.g. /SERVER [-4 | -6] [-ssl] <hub-ip> <hub-port> <ownerpass:username:userpass>
  - show syntax errors
  - .help <command> shows syntax (further descriptions may follow) 
  - added .bc <bot> help
  - added timestamps to all lines in partyline
  - allow to join partyline of slave/leaf by telnet or dcc, requires that ownerpass is set
- multiple ownerpasses can be used
  - they can also be added by: .bc <main> cfg +ownerpass <password-in-plaintext>
- resolve hostname of main/slave before linking, requires adns
- resolve hostname of irc servers before connecting, requires adns
- added 'ipv4:' and 'ipv6:' prefixes to class entHost, example: +server ipv6:localhost
- new channel mode management, use chars instead of static FLAG_*, same for sent modes
- new mode-lock
- implemented raw command: .bc <bot> raw <text>
- global and local +n can do .+user, .chanset, .mk, .bc <bot> cwho/names <chan>
- global and local +n can change channel flags of users who do not have +n too
- .+/-addr <handle> <ip4/6> allows that user to join partyline only from this ip (cidr is supported)
  - must be used for bots too
  - removed telnet-owners
  - please do not use .chaddr anymore!
- report connecting errors also when the bot was not registered on irc
- show maximum size of core file in .bc <bot> status
- added .set resolve-users-hostname which will tell the bot to resolve all hostnames of users
  who join or are already on a channel, needed for clonecheck (off by default)
   issues: - when bot connects to irc and joins channels it will resolve very much hostnames,
             same after netsplit
           - every bot resolves the hostname on its own, why don't they share the work
           - not very useful in the end
- changed password set behavior on irc (requested by AnGelZ):
  - must be enabled by .set allow-set-pass-by-msg
  - slaves/leafs can set passwords too unless the user has +xsnm and unless the user had no password set before
- leafs can save the userfile too, cfg: save-userlist ON
- implemented calculatePenalty() of "raw" module
- leafs can link to main
- added myipv6 cfg variable
- make install (thanks to [C]167)
  - ".bc <bot> update" should always work now
- warn on partyline if *.dec or seed.h was found
- clear beIR list when it is full
  - channel will be locked during the process if lockdown chanset is on

bug fixes
---------
- fixed SSL problem which caused high cpu load (#1906516)
- chanuser::updateDNSEntry() does not resolve ipv4/6 addresses anymore
- .set takes the whole string as value and not only the first word (reported by anank)
- buffered data of net.hub and net.irc has not been sent
- restart did not work if config was opened with fd=0
